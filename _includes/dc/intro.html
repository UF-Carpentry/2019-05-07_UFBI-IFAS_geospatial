The UF Carpentry Club is hosting a 1-day workshop on May 7, 2019, as a follow-up event to the <a href="https://biodiversity.institute.ufl.edu/2019/04/3rd-annual-ufbi-and-ifas-symposium/">3rd Annual UFBI and IFAS Symposium</a>.  For this workshop, we will be teaching a condensed version of the new workshop curriculum, "<a href="https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/">Introduction to Geospatial Analysis in R</a>".</p>
<p>
Have you ever not be able to recreate a map or analysis in ArcMap? Would you rather use a scripting approach to geospatial analysis? Come join us on May 7!
Because this is a 1-day workshop, we will not have time for a from-the-beginning introduction to R, so workshop participants should have at least some experience using R, but no prior experience with geospatial analysis is required.

  <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a> develops and teaches workshops on the fundamental data skills needed to conduct
  research. Its target audience is researchers who have little to no prior computational experience,
  and its lessons are domain specific, building on learners' existing knowledge to enable them to quickly
  apply skills learned to their own research.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
